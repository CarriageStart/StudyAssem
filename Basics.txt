* Program Loader Flag
_etext : The first address following the program text.
_edata : The first address following the program data region.
_end : The first address following the data region that is not
        initialized. (Often denoted as end)

* Value format
  - Decimal
  $10
  - Binary
  $0b101
  - Octal
  $010
  - Hexadecimal
  $0x000A
  - Text (ASC2)
  mytext:
    .ascii "Hello, world!\0"


* Label is pointor(Label labels memory address).
    => To use the value stored in that address, use LABEL_NAME.
    => To use as a memory address, use $LABEL_NAME.
    => Compiler section flags also can be denoted.
        ex) movq $_end, %rax
        ex2) movq $.data, %rax
        ex2) movq $.bss, %rax

  - Label is divided into Symbolic and numeric, or data access.

  1. Symbolic Labels
    - Declared as non-numeric symbol with a semicolon. 
        ex) "LABEL_NAME:"
    - global scope as default and appear in symbolic table of 
     object file.

  2. Numeric Labels
    - Number label(0~9) with a semicolon.
    - This is local scope.

  3. Pointor to data stored in Memory


* Memory Access
  - Note the real memory address of hardware cannot be dealt in any program.
    => The address in label is merely a relative position w.r.t its file location when the program is loaded.
    => All label is a relative distance in Byte from the declared 
     section(".section .data" or ".section .text").
            * Such section can be noted with $.data
                ex) movq $.rodata, %rdx
        => You often encounter an analogue of memory address as 
         "0x00000000","0x00000004". Note that this is just a
         relative position from the base(usually stack base).
        => Therefore, 4(%rbx) is also a trivial representaion.

  - .section .data  : Virtual Memory section that contains initialized(saved before execution : Load and play).
  - .section .text  : Virtual Memory section that contains machine codes.
  - .section .rdata : Vritual Memory section that contains read-only data(constant string, switch-table).
  - .section .bss   : Vritual Memory section that contains un-initialized data(Can be assumed zero).

* Constant (Macro Constant)
  - The constant is replaced with the declared value in compilation.
  - Often used, when we need to specify the layout of structured data or frame.

  ex)
  .equ WEIGHT_OFFSET, 0
  .equ HEIGHT_OFFSET, 0
  .equ HAIR_OFFSET, 0
  .equ AGE_OFFSET, 0
